# air-quality-exceptional-events-midwest-2023

This repository contains data and findings for a collaboration between MuckRock and The Chicago Tribune. Reporting and analysis in this collaboration is a follow-up to the multi-newsroom [“Smoke, Screened,” project](https://www.muckrock.com/project/smoke-screened-the-clean-air-acts-dirty-secret-1117/) published by The California Newsroom, MuckRock and the Guardian. 

"Smoke, Screened" is about the use of a legal tool called the exceptional events rule, which allows local air agencies across the United States to remove bad air days from the regulatory record of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) if the data is affected by an "exceptional event," like a wildfire.

You can find earlier "Smoke, Screened" data and analysis in [`air-quality-exceptional-events`](https://github.com/MuckRock/air-quality-exceptional-events) and [`gao-wildfire-exceptions`](https://github.com/MuckRock/gao-wildfire-exceptions). Even more data and analysis driving the investigations of MuckRock's news team are cataloged in [`news-team`](https://github.com/MuckRock/news-team).
